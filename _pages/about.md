Iâ€™m Jonas, a PhD fellow in biomolecular archaeology at the [University of Copenhagen.](https://saxo.ku.dk/forskning/forhistorisk-arkaeologi/)

My PhD-project, Shearing Trough Time - Biomolecular Insights Into Viking Age Sheep Husbandry in Denmark, is part of the [Textile Resources in Viking Age Landscapes](https://ctr.hum.ku.dk/research-programmes-and-projects/trival/)-project (or TRiVAL for short) hosted at the [Centre for Textile Research](https://ctr.hum.ku.dk/), SAXO, UCPH and funded by the Independent Research Fund Denmark (grant no. DFF-2027-00204B).

**My research**

Within the context of the Danish Late Iron Age and Viking Age (*c*. AD 400-1050) textile archaeology there were two major developments: 

1) The introduction of the sail around the 7th or 8th centuries AD.

2) A sudden shift in overall wool quality from finer to coarser fibres during the Viking Age.

The introduction of the sail made from wool is believed to have caused a significant increase in the demand for raw materials and thus sheep. However, this is rather poorly studied, as is the sudden shift in wool fibre quality. This poses a number of questions such as whether this shift was the result of the introduction of new sheep breeds with different wool qualities perhaps better suited for the production of sailcloth. Or could this be explained by changing sheep husbandry practices optimised for quantity rather than quality? Did the number of sheep actually increase with the increasing demand for raw materials? Or are we searching for a different explanation entirely?

By applying [ZooMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZooMS) and [ancient DNA analyses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_DNA), Shearing Through Time is going to provide new and unprecedented insights into how Late Iron Age and Viking Age sheep were managed, bred, and subsequently used in the production of wool textiles as well as how wool production interrelated with the overall textile economy of the period.

**About me**

I received both my bachelor's and master's degrees in prehistoric archaeology from the University of Copenhagen. For my bachelor's thesis, I did an old-school Mesolithic settlement analysis while my master's thesis was on ZooMS analyses of Swedish ovicaprine remains. Apart from this I also spent my years as an undergrad delving into areas such as zooarchaeology, biological anthropology, palaeoanthropology, experimental and funerary archaeology as well as forensic archaeology before I finally found my niche within palaeoproteomics and biomolecular archaeology.

These days I live in the quiet countryside of Northwestern Zealand in a small house with my wife (who is also an archaeologist), our son, Eske, our Finnish Lapphund, Jukka, our four chickens and four goats. 

In what little spare time I have left I enjoy spending time in nature with my family either hiking or kayaking, camping, mountain biking, rock climbing hunting or fishing.
