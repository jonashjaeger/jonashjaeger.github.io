I am a PhD fellow at the University of Copenhagen where I also received my BA and MA degrees in Scandinavian (prehistoric) archaeology. During my time as a student, I have worked with topics such as Early Maglemosian settlement variability, experimental archaeology, forensic archaeology and - of course - palaeoproteomics.

I specialize in the application of molecular biological tools to study questions related to prehistoric animal husbandry. In my current research, I study Late Iron Age ovicaprines and wool production. By applying ZooMS and aDNA-analyses, I aim to gain a deeper and more nuanced understanding of ovicaprine husbandry and the production of wool during the Late Iron Age (including the Viking Age) in Denmark,

My PhD is part of the project, Textile Resources in Viking Age Landscapes funded by the Independent Research Fund Denmark (grant no. DFF-2027-00204B).

As such, my PhD project developed from my master's thesis, a collaborative thesis at the University of Copenhagen between the Centre for Textile Research under the Department of Prehistoric Archaeology at the SAXO-Institute and the Collins Group under the Section for GeoBiology at the GLOBE-Institute. My master's thesis was written under the supervision of Prof. Eva Andersson Strand and Prof. Matthew J. Collins as will my PhD dissertation.
